Week 5 of Coursera TensorFlow 2 specialization assigment.

I the first part of the assigment I have developed a simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) model on the SVHN dataset. Which we can see is not very well suited for this dataset as it gives me a relativelly low accuracy score (refering to learning curves).

I then developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). CNNs are used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data. We see from the accuracy score - the model is much more suited for this image dataset. 

'Capstone_Project.ipynb' is a jupyter notebook file containing my code
'train_32x32.mat' - train dataset
'test_32x32.mat' - test dataset
